C# Notes

Computer looks for Main method to start program. When main method
ends, program ends.

Every time you create a new source file it will be a class.

class [nouns]
-properties (fields/variables)
-methods (functions/procedures) [actions]
	* is a reference type

Variables belong at the top of a program. Set value ASAP.
	example: var aLong = 42L

Operators
% modulus = remainder of dividend

Variable types:
-scalar [not null] numbers, boolean, dates
-reference [nullable] strings, classes
