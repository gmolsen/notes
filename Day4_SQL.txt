Day 4 SQL

Begin all variables with an @ sign
	example: declare @satscore int

What would normally be interpreted as a mathmatic equation
	example: x = 0
...is actually an ASSIGNMENT. Do all  things on the right
side of the equal sign first and then assign that value to the
variable on the left side of the equal sign.

IN operator
IS operator
	example: where MajorID is null
EXISTS operator - returns true if result set has at least 1 row
in it
	example: if exists (select 1 from student where MajorID = @MajorID)
LIKE operator only works on strings
	example: where Name like 'M_cro%'
